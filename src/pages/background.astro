      <h2>The Problem: Muscle Atrophy</h2>
      <h3>Who is at Risk?</h3>
      <p>
        Every astronaut on a long-duration mission faces this challenge. Whether it's a 6-month stay on the ISS or a 3-year journey to Mars, the human body adapts to its environment—often in ways we don't want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without gravity pulling on them, muscles begin to weaken immediately. This isn't just about strength; it's about safety. A weakened crew member might struggle with emergency procedures or be unable to walk upon returning to Earth (or landing on Mars).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Why Does It Happen?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Use it or lose it.</strong> On Earth, just standing up requires your "anti-gravity" muscles (legs and spine) to work against 1G of force. In space, that load disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body, being efficient, stops maintaining muscle it doesn't need. The result? Up to <strong>30% muscle mass loss</strong> in just six months. Bones also become brittle, increasing fracture risk.
